<p>A fleet of K identical trucks having capacity Q need to be scheduled to delivery pepsi packages from a central depot 0 to clients 1,2,…,n. Each client i requests d[i] packages. The distance from location i to location j is c[i,j], 0?i,j?n. A delivery solution is a set of routes: each truck is associated with a route, starting from depot, visiting some clients and returning to the depot for deliverying requested pepsi packages such that:</p>
<p>Each client is visited exactly by one route</p>
<p>Total number of packages requested by clients of each truck cannot exceed its capacity</p>
<p>Each truck must visit at least one client</p>
<p>Goal</p>
<p>Find a solution having minimal total travel distance</p>
<p>Note that: the orders of clients in a route is important, e.g., routes 0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 0 and 0 -&gt; 3-&gt; 2 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 0 are different.</p>
<p>Input</p>
<p>Line 1: n,K,Q (2?n?12,1?K?5,1?Q?50)</p>
<p>Line 2: d[1],...,d[n](1?d[i]?10)</p>
<p>Line i+3 (i=0,…,n): the i</p>
<p>th</p>
<p>&nbsp;row of the distance matrix c (1?c[i,j]?30)</p>
<p>Output</p>
<p>Minimal total travel distance</p>
